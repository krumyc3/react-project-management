/**
 * Fixes strange behavior of 'react-select' component at project/issues page in `filters` section: when such
 * filter has remoteOptions enabled it displays empty div with fixed size thus adding visible blank space that
 * acts like top-margin and makes UI not so neat. Should be deprecated with new version of react-select
